/**
 * Defines the primary styles for the web site that only apply to older versions
 * of Internet Explorer.
 *
 * This style sheet is only necessary if you need to support versions
 * of Internet Explorer older than version 9. IE versions 8 and older do not 
 * support media queries for CSS, which are used to adjust styles for different 
 * screen sizes.
 *
 * This style sheet assumes that you have also loaded the normal main.css. In
 * your HTML, load both styles as follows:
 *
 *  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/main.css">
 *  <!--[if (lt IE 9)&(!IEMobile)]>
 *  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/main-ie.css">
 *  <![endif]-->  
 *
 * The HTML above will load main.css for all browsers, but only load main-ie.css
 * in Internet Explorer 8 or below.
 *
 * Generally, this style sheet should contain whatever is in main.css under
 *   @media all and (min-width:536px)
 *
 * @package    ZfTemplate
 * @subpackage Stylesheets

/**
 * Use styles from LaRC CSS Library.

/**
 * Custom styles for IE8 and older.
 *
 * In general, anything that you put inside the "large screen" styles from
 * main.css should also be placed below (but not inside a @media tag).
